An analysis of the different methods of scoring employed by the top 20 highest scorers of the NBA’s 2022/2023 season using R.

The NBA nowadays is full of exciting talents who are able to score the basketball using a variety of different
methods. This project is an analysis of the different methods of scoring employed by the top 20 highest
scorers of the NBA’s 2022/2023 season to determine what these players have in common and what makes
them such effective scorers. Furthermore, the presentation aims to discover whether the volume and/or
efficiency of a type of shot can set the most elite scorers in the NBA apart from the rest.
The dataset used for the presentation was published by Basketball Reference. This dataset includes the per
game data of the leading scorers in the NBA who played more than 57 games, which is 70% of available
games in a season. This ensures that the data accurately reflects the scoring ability of players throughout a
relatively equal sample size of games.


The statistics that are looked at are the statistics of all the ways that the players can score the ball which
includes:

- Field goal attempts and field goal percentage (The amount of shots taken per match excluding free throws
and the efficiency of these shots)

- 2-point attempts and 2-point percentage (The amount of shots taken within the 3-point line per game
excluding free throws and the efficiency of these shots)

- 3-point attempts and 3-point percentage (The amount of shots taken outside the 3-point line per game
excluding free throws and the efficiency of these shots)

- Free throw attempts and free throw percentage (The amount of free throw shots per game and the efficiency
of these shots)
